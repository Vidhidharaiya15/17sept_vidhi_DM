Q-9  What is the Crawling and Indexing process and who performs it?

Ans :  Crawling and indexing are crucial processes used by search engines to gather and organize information from the web.
    Crawling
         Crawling is the process by which search engines send out bots, often called "spiders" or "crawlers," to discover and retrieve web pages. These crawlers follow links from one page to another, systematically browsing the internet to find new and updated content. The goal is to collect data about various web pages, including their content, structure, and any links to other pages.
    Indexing
         the page.Indexing comes after crawling. Once a crawler gathers information from a web page, the search engine processes that data and stores it in an index. The index is a massive database that allows the search engine to quickly retrieve relevant pages when a user performs a search. During indexing, the search engine analyzes the content, evaluates its relevance based on various algorithms, and determines how to categorize the page.
    Who Performs It?
           The crawling and indexing processes are performed by search engines like Google, Bing, and others. These engines use sophisticated algorithms and a vast network of servers to manage and optimize these tasks, ensuring that users can quickly find the most relevant information for their queries.

In summary, crawlers discover content, while indexing organizes and categorizes that content for easy retrieval.


Q-10  Difference between Organic and Inorganic results.

   . PPC Focus :  Paid search results are managed through Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising campaigns, such as Google Ads, where advertisers bid on specific keywords.
   . Cost :  The cost can vary widely depending on the competitiveness of the keywords being targeted. Advertisers pay each time a user clicks on their ad (hence "pay-per-click").
   Key Differences:
    1. Placement :  Organic results appear based on their relevance to the search term, while paid results are placed at the top or bottom of the page based on bids.
