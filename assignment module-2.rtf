\fs40 Q-9  \fs36 What is the Crawling and Indexing process and who performs it?\par
\par
Ans :  \b0\fs28 Crawling and indexing are crucial processes used by search engines to gather and organize information from the web.\par
    \b\fs32 Crawling\par
\fs28         \b0  Crawling is the process by which search engines send out bots, often called "spiders" or "crawlers," to discover and retrieve web pages. These crawlers follow links from one page to another, systematically browsing the internet to find new and updated content. The goal is to collect data about various web pages, including their content, structure, and any links to other pages.\b\fs32\par
    Indexing\par
         \b0\fs28 the page.Indexing comes after crawling. Once a crawler gathers information from a web page, the search engine processes that data and stores it in an index. The index is a massive database that allows the search engine to quickly retrieve relevant pages when a user performs a search. During indexing, the search engine analyzes the content, evaluates its relevance based on various algorithms, and determines how to categorize the page.\par
    \b\fs32 Who Performs It?\par
           \b0\fs28 The crawling and indexing processes are performed by search engines like Google, Bing, and others. These engines use sophisticated algorithms and a vast network of servers to manage and optimize these tasks, ensuring that users can quickly find the most relevant information for their queries.\par
\par
In summary, crawlers discover content, while indexing organizes and categorizes that content for easy retrieval.\par

\b    \fs32 .\fs28  \fs32 Cost :  \b0\fs28 There is no direct payment to the search engine to appear in these results. The investment is typically in time, resources, and SEO expertise.\par
   \b\fs32 Inorganic (Paid) Results:\par
    . Definition :  \b0\fs28 These are advertisements that appear on the SERP because companies pay the search engine to display them for certain keywords or phrases. They are often labeled as "Ad" or "Sponsored" to differentiate them from organic listings.\par

\b\fs32    . PPC Focus :  \b0\fs28 Paid search results are managed through Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising campaigns, such as Google Ads, where advertisers bid on specific keywords.\par
\b\fs32    . Cost :  \b0\fs28 The cost can vary widely depending on the competitiveness of the keywords being targeted. Advertisers pay each time a user clicks on their ad (hence "pay-per-click").\b\fs32\par
   Key Differences:\par
    1. Placement :  \b0\fs28 Organic results appear based on their relevance to the search term, while paid results are placed at the top or bottom of the page based on bids.\par
